1,7/11/2019,Male,Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes.,4,Positive,good
2,6/20/2019,Female,"It's competently executive as a movie, but as an adaptation... it's badly done.",3.5,Negative,bad
3,6/6/2019,Male,"The most mature Potter film yet, dealing with emotional issues much stronger than any previous installment, and the young cast more than steps up to the plate",3,Postive,mature
4,5/16/2019,Male,"While the sixth chapter in the popular series from writer J.K. Rowling has some similar problems to its predecessor, it manages to inject some much needed magic and charm back into the franchise.",3.5,Negative,magic
5,10/30/2018,Female,"With real chemistry between the characters, laugh-out-loud scenes of teen-wizard angst, and some truly spectacular cinematography, it may even be the best in the series.",4,Positive,best
6,10/30/2018,Female,"Since they do spend so much time on the teen hormone angle, I have to say that the Harry Potter-Ginny Weasley love story is disastrous in both book and film.",4.5,Negative,love story
7,3/20/2018,Female,"reaffirms the hypothesis that the sixth Harry Potter movie only constitutes of a ""transitional"" film, between the ""little wizards"" and the ""senior wizards"" that will face Voldemort in Potter's last magical battle.?",4.5,Positive,Traditional
8,1/25/2018,Female,"What I liked about this one is the mystery, which is always at the heart of a Harry Potter story.",5,Positive,mystery
9,6/28/2016,Male,"Any movie that works as a spy thriller, love story, and horror movie all at once is pretty remarkable. You might say it takes a fair amount of wizardry.",3,Negative,love story

14,11/22/2013,Female,"Not only is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince an excellent translation of J.K. Rowling's addictive canon, but it's also the first entry to shine on its own devoid of its backdrop mythology.",4.5,positive,excellent
15,11/22/2013,Male,"Seamlessly and vigorously conveyed, this satisfying segment raises the storytelling and visual-effects bar for the entire series.",4,positive,good
16,5/26/2013,Male,What fun it is to behold our budding wizards and witches learning that love is the one spell they cannot control.,3.5,Positive,love story
17,9/29/2012,Female,"If you're a fan, you're sure to find something to grumble about; ditto if you're a critic; but for the dwindling amount of people who just want to go to the movies to watch a fun and interesting movie, you could do a lot worse.",3,positive,fun
18,8/13/2012,Male,"For Potter-ites, there are plenty of satisfactions to be had, but the fun mostly comes from recognizing plot points from the novel merely suggested onscreen.",3,negative,fun
19,5/6/2011,Female,"I think it's the best of the series, fairly easily, and a testament to why occasionally throwing a massive budget at an endeavor of this scope can be considered a reasonable decision.",3.5,positive,best
20,4/4/2011,Male,"The incandescent flickers draw us into a movie that has all the hallmarks of being another dark experience. Yet, in a U-turn from the norm, The Half-Blood Prince refrains from wallowing in doom and gloom.",3,negative,/

23,11/18/2010,Female,"Yates & his technical team ... are the film's true magicians, taking the viewer's breath away ... with their cinematic craft, illusionistic skill and ... spellbinding wizardry",4,positive,good
24,10/27/2010,Male,[Harry Potter] is now the lone beacon of despair for children in an increasingly pandering and brainless cinematic landscape; a Grimm tale that should satisfy the darker whims of imaginative children.,4,positive,good
25,4/13/2010,Female,"Running an obscene 2 1/2 hours, presenting a story which could have made a halfway decent half-hour episode of a half-assed TV series, this Potter has no focus, a comprehensive plot, any semblance of cohesion, purpose, meaning.",3.5,negative,no focus
26,3/11/2010,Male,"Those previously in the dark about the story from books or films will remain so, for the 153 minutes make little clear aside from a Be-Sure-To-See-The-Sequel conclusion.",5,positive,good

31,9/20/2009,Male,"Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are great as always, but director David Yates' adherence to realism stifles J.K. Rowling's trickster-storytelling wiles. Yates' horrifically bad botching of big-ticket moments bodes poorly for the ""Deathly Hallows"" films.",4,positive,/
32,9/11/2009,Male,"In a world where the Transformers sequel can make a mint while being so lackadaisical and empty, it almost makes you wonder why the Potter crew bother to take such care. But let's not question it. Just enjoy it.",3.5,positive,good
33,8/28/2009,Male,"As the Harry Potter movies have ventured into darker, more mature territory, the series has greatly improved in one regard: The stories feel more epic, the tension more real.",4,positive,mature

40,8/9/2009,Male,"There's a welcome lightness in the romantic couplings, which will have pre-teens across America asking, ""Mom, what's snogging?""",4.5,positive,love story
41,8/9/2009,Male,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the most balanced Harry Potter film to come along...",4,positive,balanced

43,8/3/2009,Male,Half-Blood is fully worth seeing.,4,positive,good
44,7/31/2009,Male,The uniformly good performances and the often inspired craftsmanship arguably make this second only to Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban in the Potter pantheon.,4.5,positive,good

48,7/28/2009,Female,"This sixth installment is likeably unremarkable and feels like some sort of Diagon Alley deja-vu; a road, an overly long road, we've been down many times.",4.5,negative,umremarkable
49,7/28/2009,Male,"A bit long, but overall a great adventure, even for the casual Potter fan. Paul Chambers, CNN.",3.5,positive,long
